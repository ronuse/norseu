Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, 
including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. 
It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming 
language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and 
introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, 
and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely 
backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued version 2.7.18 in 2020.
